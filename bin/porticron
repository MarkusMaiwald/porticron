========================================================================

${SCRIPT_NAME} has detected that some packages need upgrading on:

    ${FQDN}
    [ ${IP} ]

The following packages are currently pending an upgrade:

$(echo "${PACKAGES}" | sed 's/^\[/    [/')

========================================================================

You can perform the upgrade by issuing the command:

    emerge -NDuk world

as root on ${FQDN}

It is recommended that you pretend the upgrade first to confirm that
the actions that would be taken are reasonable. The upgrade may be
pretended by issuing the command:

    emerge -NDuvpk world
